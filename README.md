Repository for the Homework 1 assignment in P8105.

I've created an .Rmd file in which I will include my solutions to problems 1 and 2.

Problem 1 focuses on variable types within a data frame. For the required character and factor vectors, I've included Beastie Boys themed data.
-- I had to change my code for the problem 1 data frame because my initial idea didn't return a logical value as intended. I used `case_when` to return either "greater than 0" or "less than 0", which did not correspond to the TRUE / FALSE logical values.

Problem 2 focuses on the `penguins` data set. I've typed up some descriptive statistics using inline R code. I have also created and exported a scatter plot of penguin bill length vs flipper length.
